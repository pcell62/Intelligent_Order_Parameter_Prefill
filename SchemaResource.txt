Title: Intelligent Order Parameter Prefill - Schema Resource

Purpose:
This Excel file provides a starter schema for the Intelligent Order Parameter Prefill hackathon challenge. Use this as a foundation and extend it based on your solution approach.

What You Should Do:

    EXTEND this schema - add parameters you believe are valuable

    IDENTIFY patterns through AI/ML, rules, or statistical methods

    (optional) CREATE mock datasets that reflect realistic trading scenarios

    DEVELOP profiling strategies to capture behavior and preferences

    IDEATE what historical data would enable intelligent predictions

Key Principles:

    This schema is INTENTIONALLY MINIMAL - your value comes from enrichment

    Think about contextual signals: market depth, news events, sector trends

    Consider historical patterns

    Focus on EXPLAINABILITY - traders need to understand recommendations

    Balance automation with trader control and override capability

Sheet 2: Market Data Schema
Parameter	Data Type	Description	Purpose / Usage
Time to market close	Integer	Minutes remaining until market close	Critical for urgency assessment, EOD compliance decisions
Qty	Integer	Last trade quantity (shares/units)	Recent trading activity indicator
Bid	Float	Current best bid price	Buy-side liquidity, spread calculation
Ask	Float	Current best ask price	Sell-side liquidity, spread calculation
LTP (Last Traded Price)	Float	Most recent execution price	Current market price reference
Volatility	Float (%)	Historical or intraday volatility measure across a defined time frame	Risk assessment, algo aggression tuning, slippage estimation
Average Trade Size	Float	Mean trade size over recent period (e.g., last hour, last day)	Benchmark for order size, stealth trading strategy
Sheet 3: Order Data Schema
Parameter	Data Type	Description	Purpose / Usage
Cpty (Counterparty)	String	Client or counterparty identifier	Key for client profiling, historical matching
Size	Integer	Order size in shares/units	Relative to ADV determines market impact, algo choice
Order type	Enum	Market, Limit, or other specialized types (Stoploss etc.)	Defines execution urgency and price constraints
Algo Type	Enum	POV, VWAP, ICEBERG, or other execution algorithms	Determines execution strategy
Start Time	Timestamp	Scheduled start time for algo execution	Timing constraint for execution window
End Time	Timestamp	Target completion time for order	Deadline for execution, impacts urgency
Order notes	Text	Free-text notes or special instructions from client	Captures client intent, special requirements, compliance notes
Direction	Enum	Buy or Sell	Determines market side, impacts strategy selection and aggression strategy
Symbol	String	Instrument identifier (ticker, ISIN, or exchange code)	Identifies specific stock for trading
Limit Price	Float	Maximum buy price or minimum sell price threshold	Price constraint for limit orders, determines how close it is to the market price
Sheet 4: Algo Parameters Schema
POV (Percentage of Volume)
Parameter	Data Type	Description	Purpose / Usage
Target participation rate (%)	Float	Percentage of market volume to target (e.g., 10% = participate in 10% of total volume)	Balances urgency vs stealth; higher = faster but more market impact
Min/Max order size	Integer	Minimum and maximum clip size for individual child orders	Prevents too-small or too-large individual orders
Aggression level	Enum/Float	Low/Medium/High or numeric scale (e.g., 1-10)	Controls how aggressively algo crosses spread or posts liquidity
VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
Parameter	Data Type	Description	Purpose / Usage
Volume curve distribution	Enum/String	Historical, Front-loaded, Back-loaded, Custom curve	Determines how order is distributed across time window relative to expected volume
Max % of volume	Float	Maximum participation rate at any interval (e.g., 20%)	Caps market impact during low-volume periods
Aggression level	Enum/Float	Low/Medium/High or numeric scale	Controls willingness to cross spread vs wait for passive fills
ICEBERG
Parameter	Data Type	Description	Purpose / Usage
Display quantity	Integer	Visible order size shown to market	Hides true order size to reduce information leakage and market impact
Aggression level	Enum/Float	Low/Medium/High - controls refresh behavior and price improvement	Higher aggression = more frequent refreshes, tighter spreads
